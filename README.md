# Deep-Learning-Project
"""
This repository contains a jupyter notebook file which reproduces our most central results. It needs our PaINN model which is contained in the file:

painn_transition1x.sd

The path to this file needs to be stated in the notebook for it to work. Also, the zip file: configs_H4CO.zip contains approximately 1400 relaxed structures which is convenient when running the notebook. Hence, the path to this folder is also needed in the notebook.

Enjoy!
